# python-challenge
For this project, two python scripts were written to analyze two separate csv files.  One file contains financial records and the other election results.  Using python, both files are imported and a series of calculations are run.  The results are exported to a new csv file.  For the election dataset, total votes are calculated and total votes and percentage of the total votes for each candidate are calculated.  For the financial records dataset, total months and total net amount of profits/losses for the period are calculated.  In addition average change, greatest increase in profits and greatest decrease in losses for the entire period are calculated.
